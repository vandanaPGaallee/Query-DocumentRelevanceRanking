This repository consists of Jupyter notebook and python files that implements a Regression model in python to predict the relevance between a query and document. This project model is trained over LETOR dataset of 69623 query-document pair where each pair is represented using 46 feature vector. This LETOR problem is solved by both linear regression using both closed form solution and stochastic gradient descent methods. The target rankings are scalars that can take values on a scale of 1 to 5. The notebook consists of the steps to preprocess, feature selection, training and evaluation for the given task.
